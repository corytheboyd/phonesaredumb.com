                Phones are so dumb they have their own game. The "game" is that
                it's funny when audibly exchanged information becomes garbled
                and unrecognizable.

                If your communication method necessitates verifying messages
                with a language of "foxtrot uniform charlie kilo india november
                golf" nonsense, you are using the wrong communication method.

                So you translate <code>The Code</code> from military gibberish

                Your phone rings two weeks later, and it's time to recall

              The best part is, we <em>already</em> have this amazing

                An email message does not break down in transit. It is delivered
                to you exactly as sent. It does this every single time, with no
                exceptions. You either receive an email, or you do not receive
                an email.

                A game of "email" with your friends would be quite boring
                compared to a game of "telephone". Perhaps the computers would
                find it amusing? Not sure if AI is there yet or not.

                The letters of the alphabet that are combined to form the words
                in an email are, believe it or not, the
                <em>same exact</em> letters that <em>you</em> already know!
                Email participants do not need to use a made up alphabet to
                verify that each letter is indeed the correct letter.

                Emails can even include adorable "picture words", or "emojis" as
                the kids call them. Try saying this over the phone: 😍🌋👽

              <p>
                An email message is an array of binary data managed by a cold,
                heartless, robot. The robot does not misplace messages. The
                robot does not incorrectly recite messages. If you need to read
                an old message, even if it is from 10 years ago, the robot has
                your back.

                It's indeed sad that you no longer need your Hello Kitty
